# Busy [2025]Summer Sewing
[back to Homepage](./)

I've been busy sewing this summer and it has been wonderful. Overall I continued finding countless  inspiration on Pinterest and Youtube, and also had plenty of hands-on experience, astonishing myself in the process of what I could do. 
Here is the list of projects:

### Skort _#damn-girl!_ 
**Thoughts**: I am surprised at how this one turned out. Besides loving the fabric, this was my first go at using a store-bought pattern. 
What’s New: I picked up the pattern months prior to actually getting the sewing done. Execution took a long while!
There are ways to preserve the pattern by using freezer paper and ironing each pattern piece onto it. 
Making a muslin pays off. In my first attempt I sewed the skort a smaller size than what I needed and ventured into adjusting the pattern for a looser fit around the belly. The adjustments did not go great but I learned tons by trying to troubleshoot.
Notes for next time: The fabric is super cute but not right for the type of garment. After several hours of walking with the pants on, the inner tight fabric area showed the constant rubbing will require me to patch it soon.

### Trip to Mood Fabrics (+ other fabric stores)#worth-the-hype?
**Thoughts**: Saying that walking through so many fabric tubes and samples is overwhelming is a damn understatement. With that said, going to Mood Fabrics has been on my life bucket list from the days I used to watch Project Runway. 
What’s New: The interest to start sewing and crafting erupted after I got to see folks posting their process online, many of whom dived into the craft during the pandemic’s lockdown (2020). Blogs, Youtube channels, and Pinterest all suggested online fabric stores, so naturally I got started purchasing from them for my projects. 
Notes for Next Time: Eh, it’s nice to examine fabric and notions physically, but the overwhelm is inevitable. Opting for the fabric recommended on the pattern instructions and making use of the fabric sample book would work just fine. I’ll reserve fabric store visits to peruse through - and not to rush through like a contestant in Project Runway!.

### Setting Up a Projector for Sewing #exciting

**Thoughts**: This is the one thing that makes me feel so cool, despite not getting to use it much, yet. The ultimate goal is to go from projection-to-cutting but I still have strong reservations around miscutting and wasting fabric.
What's New: At this point I had the experience of putting together a Staples-printed pattern and handling a store-bought pattern, so the idea of not going through all that fuss was appealing. 
Notes for Next Time: I realized that physically manipulating patterns is important to me, even more so this early in my journey. That means that I will most likely proceed to project pattern pieces onto paper, which I’ll then cut out and pin to my fabric before cutting. I’ve also seen some creators transfer hand-drafted patterns to a digital medium, which makes it easier to share or even monetize. I don’t have intentions to monetize what I make, but the idea of building community and sharing me-made things is exciting. Overall it was worth setting up and I'm glad it is ready to go for whenever I need to trace (or cut!) my new project.

### Sewing a Pin Cushion #cute-af
**Thoughts**: The cutest thing, and so useful.
What’s New: The magnetic pin holder I was using proved to only be able to loosely hold a few pins at any given time, resulting in so many accidental pokes on my feet and legs, occasionally dragging pins on my clothes - and inevitably  pins all over the house. To fill up the pin cushion, I got to use scraps that would have otherwise been thrown out. The material turned to be great at keeping the long pins secured into the cushion.
 Notes for Next Time: I’ll make a new one until I need it but the tailor’s ham is next. I love not spending money if I don't have to. Plus again, make it cute!

### Outdoor sofa cushion covers _#damn-girl!_ _#proud_

**Thoughts**: Wow. I did that. This one is special because I got to go through the many steps involved in the craft and did so with observation, research, and the good old ‘just tryin’ things.
What’s New: For this project I was simply tasked to ‘create a cover for the outdoor sofa cushions’. First, I inspected the shape and patterns between the cushions, took measurements, and then hand-drafted the base pattern keeping the need for future alterations in mind. Outdoor cushions should be able to survive lots of sun and rain, so the type of materials used was also important and the preferences other than my own needed to be considered. I was able to purchase the fabric at a store in Brooklyn (first time, exciting too!) and notions online from Wawak and Amazon. From creating and adjusting the muslin to waiting for special notions to arrive, producing the real thing took months! I learned that the non-sewing part of sewing is what takes the longest (#dead) but hey, I’m so proud of this whole journey.
Notes for Next Time: I rock. Period. But also, this is the part of myself/brain that I love. It reminded me of why Im an engineer; there is something about having a final goal in mind that with enough humility, curiosity, and tenacity you/I can achieve the final goal. Incredible, but like for real, I can do hard things.

### Mending Worn out Pants
**Thoughts**: Craving more of a fellow crafter community, I found a local class in decorative mending, an Introduction to Sashiko Techniques. I loved meeting new folks from around town but also fell in love with the textures and colors I used to re-design my worn out jeans ( yes, from Target but they fit like a glove!). 
What's New: Videos related to visible mending had been popping up on social media but I hadn’t tried these techniques before the class. As it is for sewing, the planning takes way longer than the actual mending but the result is worth it.I also found that some aspects of the mending could be done using the sewing machine, allowing me to really take my time to design and hand-sew the cool Sashiko patterns.

What a summer eh? I’ve learned tons and yet I still want to head on to the next project (...more like projects). I’d love to get back to sewing clothing and accessories for myself and as gifts.
