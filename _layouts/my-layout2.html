<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I am surprised at how this one turned out. Besides loving the fabric, this was my first go at using a store-bought pattern.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> I picked up the pattern months prior to actually getting the sewing done. Execution took a long while!</p>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Preserve patterns with freezer paper. Making a muslin pays off. Adjusting for fit is a learning process!</p>
  <p><strong>Notes for next time:</strong> Cute fabric, but not ideal for this garment. Watch for wear in high-friction areas.</p>

## <span id="mood-fabrics">Trip to Mood Fabrics <span class="tag">#worth-the-hype?</span></span>
<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Walking through so many fabric tubes and samples is overwhelming! Mood Fabrics has been on my bucket list since Project Runway.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> The interest to start sewing and crafting erupted after seeing folks post their process online.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes for Next Time:</strong> Physical shopping is fun but overwhelming. Use sample books and recommended fabrics for less stress.</p>

## <span id="projector">Setting Up a Projector for Sewing <span class="tag">#exciting</span></span>
<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> This makes me feel so cool, even if I haven’t used it much yet!
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> Experience with printed and store-bought patterns made projection appealing.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes for Next Time:</strong> I’ll likely project onto paper first, then cut and pin. Sharing digital patterns builds community!</p>

## <span id="pin-cushion">Sewing a Pin Cushion <span class="tag">#cute-af</span></span>
<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> The cutest thing, and so useful.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> Magnetic pin holders aren’t enough. Scraps make great filling!</p>
  <p><strong>Notes for Next Time:</strong> Make a tailor’s ham next. Save money, make it cute!</p>

<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> Wow. I did that. This project involved observation, research, and just trying things.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> Tasked to create covers, I hand-drafted patterns and chose materials for durability.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes for Next Time:</strong> I rock. This reminded me why I’m an engineer—curiosity and tenacity achieve goals!</p>

## <span id="mending-pants">Mending Worn Out Pants</span>
<div class="magazine-section">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Thoughts:</strong> I found a local class in decorative mending and loved meeting fellow crafters.
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>What’s New:</strong> Tried visible mending and Sashiko techniques. Planning takes longer than mending, but the results are worth it.</p>
